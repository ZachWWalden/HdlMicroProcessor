2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks core_clk_clk_gen and core_clk_clk_gen_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks core_clk_clk_gen] -to [get_clocks core_clk_clk_gen_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks core_clk_clk_gen and mem_clk_clk_gen_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks core_clk_clk_gen] -to [get_clocks mem_clk_clk_gen_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#3 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks core_clk_clk_gen_1 and core_clk_clk_gen are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks core_clk_clk_gen_1] -to [get_clocks core_clk_clk_gen]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#4 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks core_clk_clk_gen_1 and mem_clk_clk_gen are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks core_clk_clk_gen_1] -to [get_clocks mem_clk_clk_gen]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#5 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks mem_clk_clk_gen and core_clk_clk_gen_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks mem_clk_clk_gen] -to [get_clocks core_clk_clk_gen_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#6 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks mem_clk_clk_gen and mem_clk_clk_gen_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks mem_clk_clk_gen] -to [get_clocks mem_clk_clk_gen_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#7 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks mem_clk_clk_gen_1 and core_clk_clk_gen are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks mem_clk_clk_gen_1] -to [get_clocks core_clk_clk_gen]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#8 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks mem_clk_clk_gen_1 and mem_clk_clk_gen are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks mem_clk_clk_gen_1] -to [get_clocks mem_clk_clk_gen]
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-2#1 Warning
Port pin INOUT inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) pipeline/execute_stage/alu/shifter/oe direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (pipeline/execute_stage/alu/shifter/oe) connected to this hierarchical pin/port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#1 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin sys_clk_gen/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKFBOUT but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clkfbout_clk_gen, clkfbout_clk_gen_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#2 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin sys_clk_gen/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: core_clk_clk_gen, core_clk_clk_gen_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-56#3 Warning
Missing logically or physically excluded clock groups constraint  
Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin sys_clk_gen/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT1 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: mem_clk_clk_gen, mem_clk_clk_gen_1
